# Raw Idea

**Feature Name:** Sprint 2 - Enhanced Tracking

**Description:**
This sprint extends the AgentOS-Tracker application with enhanced tracking capabilities:

1. **Test CRUD Operations**: Full management of tests with status tracking (pending/passed/failed)
2. **Bug Tracking**: Bug management with severity levels and priority settings
3. **Feature Progress Metrics**: Task completion percentage, test pass rates per feature
4. **Project-Level Rollup**: Aggregated metrics at the project level

This is the logical continuation of Sprint 1 (Dual Kanban System) which implemented the kanban boards for features and tasks.

The project is a Next.js application located at: /Users/cedricgicquiaud/Desktop/DESKTOP/GIVEME5/PROJETS_WINDSURF/AgentOS-Tracker
