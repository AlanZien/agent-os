# Product Mission

## Pitch

**AgentOS Tracker** is a visibility and tracking companion tool for agent-os that helps developers monitor all workflow activities through a unified interface. It replaces Notion as the central hub for tracking projects, specifications, tasks, and tests generated by the agent-os workflow engine.

## Agent-OS Integration

AgentOS Tracker serves as the **tracking layer** while agent-os serves as the **workflow engine**:

```
agent-os (orchestration) --feeds--> AgentOS Tracker (visibility)
```

### Data Flow from Agent-OS

| Agent-OS Command | Creates in Tracker |
|------------------|-------------------|
| `/plan-product` | Project |
| `/write-spec` | Spec (sub-project) |
| `/create-tasks` | Tasks |
| `/plan-tests` | Tests |
| `/implement` | Progress updates |
| `/verify` | Status updates |

### Spec Lifecycle Tracking

Specs progress through the agent-os workflow phases:
```
raw-idea --> shape --> write --> tasks --> implement --> verify
```

Each phase is tracked and visualized in the Tracker.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Solo Developers**: Developers using agent-os who need centralized visibility into their workflow
- **Future: Agent-OS Community**: Public deployment for other agent-os users

### User Persona

**The Agent-OS Developer** (25-45)
- **Role:** Full-stack developer working with the agent-os workflow
- **Context:** Uses agent-os agents to generate specs, tasks, and tests
- **Pain Points:**
  - No centralized place to see all workflow output
  - Manual tracking in Notion is disconnected from agent-os
  - No visibility into project velocity and progress
  - Can't link tasks to GitHub activity
- **Goals:**
  - Single dashboard for all agent-os activities
  - Track progress per spec and across entire projects
  - Link tasks directly to GitHub PRs and branches
  - View metrics and completion rates at a glance

## The Problem

### Visibility Gap in Agent-OS Workflow

Agent-os generates projects, specs, tasks, and tests, but there's no integrated tool to track and visualize this output. Developers resort to disconnected tools like Notion, losing the connection between workflow phases.

**Our Solution:** A purpose-built tracker that receives data from agent-os at each workflow step, providing real-time visibility into projects, specs, tasks, tests, and progress metrics.

## Differentiators

### Native Agent-OS Integration

Unlike generic task tools, AgentOS Tracker is designed specifically for the agent-os workflow. Data flows automatically from agent-os commands into the tracker.

### Hierarchical Entity Model

Clear hierarchy: **Projects** contain **Specs** contain **Tasks** and **Tests**. Progress rolls up from tasks to specs to projects.

### Spec Lifecycle Visibility

Track specs through all phases: raw-idea, shape, write, tasks, implement, verify. See exactly where each spec is in the workflow.

### 5-Column Task Workflow

Tasks progress through a refined Kanban workflow:
1. **A Faire** - Task created, ready to start
2. **En cours** - Actively being worked on
3. **En attente** - Blocked or waiting
4. **En cours de validation** - PR submitted, in review
5. **Termine** - Complete and merged

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **Project Dashboard:** Overview of all projects with key metrics
- **Spec Tracking:** View specs by lifecycle phase with progress indicators
- **Kanban Board:** Drag-and-drop task management with 5 status columns
- **Test Tracking:** Test plans and execution status per spec

### Metrics Features

- **Progress Metrics:** Completion rates per spec and project
- **Velocity Tracking:** Tasks completed over time
- **Status Breakdown:** Visual distribution across statuses

### Integration Features

- **GitHub Integration:** Link tasks to branches/PRs, auto-sync on merge
- **Agent-OS API:** Receive data from agent-os commands

### Planning Features

- **Timeline View:** Visualize tasks and specs on a timeline
- **Due Date Tracking:** Upcoming deadlines and overdue items
